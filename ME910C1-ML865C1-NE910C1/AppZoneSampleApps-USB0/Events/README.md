### Events

Sample application showcasing events setup and usage. Debug prints on **USB0**


**Features**


- How to setup OS events with a custom bitmask
- How to wait for events and generate them in callback functions to synchronize blocks of code


#### Application workflow

**`M2MB_main.c`**

- Open USB/UART/UART_AUX
- Create an event handler
- Create a timer to generate an event, with a 2 seconds expiration time
- Wait for a specific event bit on the event handler
- At timer expiration, set the same event bit and verify that the code flow went through after the event.
