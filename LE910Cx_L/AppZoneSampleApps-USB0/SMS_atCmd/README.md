Optional configuration file to be put in `/data/azc/mod` folder, copy `sms_config.txt` file into your module running the following AT command: 

```
AT#M2MWRITE="/data/azc/mod/sms_config.txt",138

```

#### Application workflow

**`M2MB_main.c`**

- Print welcome message
- Init SMS functionality
- Read configuration file sms_config.txt (send SMS with AT command answer back, delte SMS received)
- Init AT command parser
- Create a task to handle SMS parsing and AT command sending
- Wait for an incoming SMS
